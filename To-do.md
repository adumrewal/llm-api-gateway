## To-do-list: (Not in any particular order)

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement a rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API across different clients.
Based on the provided codebase for the Heimdall AI Gateway Service, here are some potential features that could be added to enhance the project:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement a rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API across different clients.

2. **Caching**: Add a caching layer for frequently requested prompts to reduce latency and API costs.

3. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming responses for long-running model calls, allowing clients to receive partial results as they become available.

4. **Custom Model Configurations**: Allow users to define and save custom model configurations (e.g., specific prompt templates, parameter sets) that can be easily reused.

5. **Multi-Model Aggregation**: Implement a feature to call multiple models in parallel and aggregate their responses, providing a more robust and diverse output.

6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Enhance the existing routing logic to include more sophisticated fallback mechanisms, such as retrying with different models or parameters in case of failures.

7. **Usage Analytics**: Implement detailed usage tracking and analytics to provide insights into API usage patterns, popular models, and performance metrics.

8. **API Key Management**: Add a system for managing API keys for clients, including key rotation and usage quotas.

9. **Prompt Templates**: Create a library of reusable prompt templates that users can easily customize and use in their API calls.

10. **Model Performance Monitoring**: Implement a system to monitor and compare the performance of different models and providers over time.

11. **Webhook Support**: Add support for webhooks to allow asynchronous model calls and notifications.

12. **Fine-tuning Integration**: Provide an interface for users to manage and use their fine-tuned models across different providers.

13. **Content Moderation**: Implement a content moderation layer to filter inappropriate inputs and outputs.

14. **Automatic Provider Selection**: Develop an intelligent system that automatically selects the best provider based on factors like performance, cost, and availability.

15. **Versioning System**: Implement a versioning system for the API to ensure backward compatibility as new features are added.


#### To implement these features, you would need to modify and extend various parts of the existing codebase. For example:

1. The `LLMRouter` class in the router.py file (```python:heimdall/service/router/router.py```) would need to be extended to support features like multi-model aggregation and automatic provider selection.

2. The FastAPI app configuration in the contract/__init__.py file (```python:heimdall/contract/__init__.py```) would need to be updated to include new endpoints for features like API key management and analytics.

3. New modules might need to be created for features like caching, rate limiting, and content moderation.

4. The `ClientCallDataModel` in the typing.py file (```python:heimdall/typing.py```) would need to be extended to support new parameters for features like streaming responses and custom model configurations.
